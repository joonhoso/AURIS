A new, open source mission control system in Haskell

A mission control system is the ground software that controls satellites
and space probes. An example of an actual operational system can be seen
here (example from the European Space Operations Center ESOC, on the
monitors):
[[https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2015/08/Mission_control_system][ESA's
SCOS-2000]] or from the German Space Operations Center (GSOC):

** First Screenshots
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: first-screenshots
   :END:

Please note that these screenshots are preliminary. The displays are
still subject to major changes, also most implementations are not
complete.

There are currently 2 themes available, one dark and one (newer) based
on neumorphic principles

** More Information

See also the [[https://github.com/oswald2/AURIS/wiki][wiki]] for more information.

*** Dark Theme

Telemetry Frame Display:

The commanding interface currently is a very simple implementation to be
able to send commands to every interface in the system. The commands
currently are specified in textual form, so the GUI for this is minimal:

The *TC History* is also very fresh and not completely implemented and
does not yet show all necessary information:

** Building
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: building
   :END:

Currently, building via stack is recommended. Cabal new-* commands
should also work, but currently there is no cabal.project file
available.

*** Dependencies

AURIS uses GTK with the gobject introspection bindings in Haskell. So several packages need to be installed beforehand. On Ubuntu based systems these are the following:

 - =make=
 - =g++ (libstdc++)=
 - =libgmp=
 - =gobject-instrospection=
 - GTK3 + development packages

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo apt install build-essential libgmp-dev gobject-introspection libgirepository-1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libgtksourceview-3.0-dev
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Building with =stack=

There following =stack.yaml= files provided:
 - =stack.yaml=: this is for developing with non-optimized code and faster compile times
 - =stack_opt.yaml=: this is for the optimized build (much slower)
 - =stack_llvm:yaml=: optimized build via LLVM (much much slower)
 - =stack_sle.yaml=: build with the SLE interface. CAUTION: this build requires the ESA C++ SLE API version 5.1.0 (or above) and the sle-wrapper library.

To build it quickly, but without any optimization:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
stack build
#+END_EXAMPLE

or:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
stack install
#+END_EXAMPLE

To build with the other options, simply specify the desired stack file, e.g.:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
stack --stack-yaml stack_llvm.yaml build
#+END_EXAMPLE


*** Using nix
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: using-nix
    :END:

*Note*: this section must be re-checked!

This project can also be built using =nix-build=. This will use
[[file:haskell.nix][https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix]] to
derive nix expressions from the =stack.yaml= and then build the local
packages using the same versions as in the stackage =resolver= and
=extra-deps=. However many of the packages might not be pre-built, but
you can try to use =cachix= from =iohk=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cachix use iohk
  nix-build -A esa-space-protocols.components.all
  ls result/bin
  # CommandingAD  CommandingTest  EventLoggingDBTest  TMModelTest  TMSimulatorTest  WriteConfig
#+END_SRC

There is also a =shell.nix= which provides build tools and dependencies
like =ghc=, =cabal= and =stack= and =ghcide=. Inside the shell you can
build using =cabal= and =stack --no-nix --system-ghc --no-install-ghc=,
or let =stack --nix= use the =shell.nix= (but this requires =stack= on
your host system).

If you have [[file:lorri][https://github.com/target/lorri]] set up, you
get this things even set up when cd'ing in this environment!

** Data Processing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: data-processing
   :END:

The (much simplified) architecture of the data processing backend looks like this:

[[./architecture.svg]]

The real data processing paths (only the core processing, no GUI) that are currently implemented, can be seen here:

[[./figures/data_pipelines.svg]]

The automatic layout of graphviz as a bit unfortunate. If somebody knows how to generate a better layout, let me know.

The main interfaces (network interfaces, application interface, GUI) are shown as colored rectangles.
Rainbow-colored rectangles show threads, boxes within them show either conduits or functions.
STM Queues are shown separate from threads, as (of course) they are accessed from multiple threads.

All data processing is currently done in =esa-space-protocols=
which is the main library.

** User Interface
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: user-interface
   :END:

The libraries are designed so that they will be able to be used in a
variety of situations: client/server, standalone as one binary, use the
libraries alone in other projects etc.

A standalone executable with a GUI is called AURISi (for AURIS
integrated) in the 'aurisi' directory.

The AURISi executable uses GTK for the graphical user interface.

* More Information

There is more information available (restructuring and growing) on the Wiki on github: [[https://github.com/oswald2/AURIS/wiki][wiki]]

** Database
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: database
   :END:

The initial goal was to support at least 2 backends: sqlite for testing campaigns
and Postgres for MCS/CCS activities. After several tests, the current main backend is
MongoDB, as it showed to be the fastest for the use cases. The current DB backend
implementation can be found in =esa-db-mongodb=. If no backend is specified in the
AURISi configuration, it is started just for online processing.

The DB backend is designed for streaming. There are currently three separate store processes
(one for TM Frames, one for PUS Packets and one for TM Packets),
that just listen on queues, flush the queues if possible (so get all data currently in the queue as a list)
and stores them into the DB.

A separate query processor thread is directly attached to the application interface for
incoming requests from the outside (currently only GUI). This functionality is currently
very sparsely implemented, so retrievals are currently only very limited.

** Satellite Mission Information Base
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: satellite-information-base
   :END:

Currently the MIB library is under work to load satellite information
from a MIB in SCOS-2000 Format (Version 6.9). Currently, the TM information
can be loaded to decode TM Frames and TM Packets, most functionality for extraction
is supported (with exception of deduced parameters and synthetic parameters).
For commanding, basic TCs can be generated form the MIB, but some parameter types
are not yet supported (there are also bugs with calibrated parameters).

It may be, that a CDM library for EGS-CC based configurations will follow (maybe).

** Protocols
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: protocols
   :END:

The currently working protocols are NCTRS (TC and TM, no ADMIN currently and no AD mode),
C&C and EDEN. Since NCTRS is not that common
anymore, other protocols will also be supported.

Work has already begun on the implementation of an SLE library, to be
able to connect to ground stations without relay/routing software as for
NCTRS. The SLE implementation is in a very early state and currently not
usable and can be found here:
[[https://github.com/oswald2/esa-sle][esa-sle]]
This is in a very early state and not usable. An intermediate solution
which uses ESA's C++ SLE API is in work, but this applies to ESA license
schemes and will not be present on github.


** Notes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: notes
   :END:

- The [[https://github.com/gregorycollins/hashtables][hashtables]]
  library has been forked and directly put into this mono-repo. What has
  been modified is that an immutable hash table type has been added (but
  only for the Basic ST hash table), which can be obtained by calling
  =unsafeFreeze=. This allows to pass the HashTable out of the ST monad,
  but also only read-only functions are allowed. Currently, only
  =ilookup=, =fold= and =toList= are implemented.
- The timer functionality is still undecided. Currently, both =updatable-timers= and =timer-wheel= are used.
- State machines need more research. Combining state machines with STM and timers is quite challenging. This is needed for the COP-1 machine for AD mode as well as for the Verification timers and the OBQM implementation.

** Contributing

All contributions are welcome, though I am aware that there is quite an entry hurdle as the topic of mission control is a very
niche topic and there is not really much broad knowledge available. Things to implement can be found on the Issues page on github.
They are often broader topics, which should be split into sub-tasks before. I try to keep them up-to-date as far as possible.

As this is not a simple topic, please ask questions. For issues, this can be directly done in the Issues pages or on the dedicated
Discord server for the system [[https://discord.gg/S7MySPc5EW][Discord]].

See the file [[CONTRIBUTING.md][CONTRIBUTING.md]] on how to contribute.
