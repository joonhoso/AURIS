Module      : Interface.Interface
Description : Central data type and functions for interacting with the MCS
Copyright   : (c) Michael Oswald, 2019

Maintainer  : michael.oswald@onikudaki.net
Stability   : experimental
Portability : POSIX

This module contains the central data type of the interface. It consists
of a table of functions (actions) which need to be wired to the functions
in the used libraries (e.g. esa-space-protocols). This is the direction 
of actions/activities. 

The other directions happens via events. The 'Interface' also contains
a 'raiseEvent' function which is used to inform the external clients
about things happening in the MCS.

The 'Interface' can be used locally only (within one process) directly 
with the 'Interface' data type. Also available is a socket based interface
(see 'Interface.SocketInterface'), which must be instantiated on startup 
and added to the 'Interface' via the 'addInterface' function. The socket
interface can communicate with a client via either Strings, Binary or JSON.

-- | Like 'callInterface', but, since 'callInterface' is asynchronous, this is a 
-- synchronous version. It must use a synchronous action, which takes a TMVar. 
-- The TMVar should be filled by the action with the result. 'syncCallInterface' 
-- waits until the TMVar is filled with the result and returns the result.
--
-- Note that this is slower and possibly blocking, so this function should only 
-- be used when really needed. It is best to use the asynchronous mechanism and
-- just react to the returned events. 
-- Therefore, not many synchronous actions are provided
